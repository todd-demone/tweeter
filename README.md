# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Purpose
I created Tweeter while completing the [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) [Web Development Flex Program](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program). The project helped develop my HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, jQuery, AJAX and Webpack front-end skills, and Node and Express back-end skills.
